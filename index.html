            This is as it said, Nigeria’s economy is receiving investment inflows worth $14bn from Indian businesses that pledged to invest in the country at the G20 Summit held last September. While describing the recent killings in Plateau State as “regrettable,” it vowed that its perpetrators must face justice.

            The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, disclosed these in a statement he signed on Sunday, titled ‘Amidst challenges, Nigeria will forge ahead.’</p><br>

                   <p>The Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service has asked Nigerian ssocialite and businesswoman, Aisha Achimugu, to remember to file her annual tax returns.
           
                       The call came amid the outcry that greeted the businesswoman’s lavish 50th birthday celebration.
                       
                       The FCT-IRS gave the reminder in a now-deleted post on X (formerly X) while responding to a post on the seven-day party, which Achimugu hosted in Grenada, a Caribbean Island country.
                    “The FCT-Internal Revenue Service extends our warmest birthday wishes to you! May this special day be filled with joy and blessing. Remember to fulfill your tax obligations by filing your annual tax returns,” the post read.</p>

                   <p><b><i>Football is one of the most popular sports in Nigeria, and it has produced numerous stars who started from scratch to become household names. OGHENOVO EGODO-MICHAEL takes a look at some football stars who defied all odds to attain greatness</i></b><br><br>Victor Osimhen currently plays as a striker for Serie A club, Napoli, in Italy, as well as the Nigerian national team.
           
                       Born on December 29, 1998, in Lagos, Nigeria, Osimhen started playing football at a young age, and joined Ultimate Strikers Academy in Nigeria, before moving to Wolfsburg in Germany.
                       
                       Osimhen rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most promising young talents in the world of football. His story is one of perseverance, hard work, and determination in the face of adversity. He grew up in a large family with five siblings, who were raised by his mother after his father passed away when he was just six years old. To survive with his family, the  striker hawked sachet water popularly known as ‘pure water’ on the streets. Despite the challenges he faced growing up in the slum, Osimhen showed an early interest in football and never gave up on his dreams.</p>

                       The kidnappers were demanding N700m ransom for nine of their victims.</p>

               <p>A middle school teen, Heman Bekele, has emerged as  ‘top young scientist’ after inventing a bar of soap that can cure melanoma, a type of skin cancer.
           
                   The 14-year-old ninth-grade Annandale, Virginia, won the award after beating nine other contestants.

                   <p>THERE is not much hope that President Bola Tinubu will trim his Federal Executive Council anytime soon. Initially comprising 48 members – including the suspended Betta Edu and Simon Lalong, who resigned – the President justified the bloated cabinet in a recent interface with the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Abuja. This is anticlimactic. With Nigeria facing economic headwinds in part because of the colossally high cost of governance, the President should cut his administration’s coat according to its cloth.</p>

                   <p>Good evening ma, I chatted with you in 2021 about a guy who jilted me and an ugly past too. God has decided to change my shame to fame, my disappointments to testimonies after I left everything in his hand. Mummy, I got married to one of God’s sons last month. He’s God sent. He treats me like a queen in fact, God is great. God is merciful. He gave me a second chance, He answered my secret prayers. Thank you, mummy Temilolu, for your advice back. It indeed pays to stay chaste. I don’t deserve this mercy but God showed it to me.<br>
